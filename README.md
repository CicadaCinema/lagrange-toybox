# Lagrange Toybox
## https://cicadacinema.github.io/lagrange-toybox/

A Geogebra applet for constructing a Lagrange interpolating polynomial passing through arbitrarily many user-defined points.

## Usage

1. Select "Tools" in the sidebar.
2. Under "Basic Tools" select "Point".
3. Click anywhere on the graph to add a point. Continue adding points by clicking on an empty area of the graph, or click and drag an existing point to move it.

A single polynomial should be plotted, which passes through all the points.
